Hit a few problems. One about startify...

One about SemshiBufWipeout:
```
Error detected while processing BufWipeout Autocommands for "*":
E117: Unknown function: SemshiBufWipeout
```
Github issues suggesgt the fix may be running `:UpdateRemotePlugins` but I couldn't do that.

Things got weird, so I quit nvim and restarted.
I got an `Error on execute python script: request error nvim_command - Vim(pyxfile):E319: No "python3" provider found. Run ":checkhealth provider"`
