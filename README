Scripts to setup a mac workstation how I like it.


## TO FIX:
### 11/14/2025
* `z` installs but command not found
* terminal colors are not being set correctly. - when I try to set dark mode on iterm, it doesn't work, and the colors and prompt that should be set in my zshrc aren't working either.

### 04/02/2025

* Brew bundle has a bunch of casks/taps saying "No formula for Apple Silicon" and twilio takes forever or hangs, unsure which

## Improvements TODO:
[ ] 
[ ] Update everything installed with brew bundle and make brew bundle fast again

# Usage
## pre-setup on brand new mac
1. Download xtools from the app store (theoretcially `xcode-select --install` will work, but it doesn't always). This will install git
2. `mkdir -p workspace/tmp` - the workspace will store git repos, and the tmp dir will store the https version of `mac-setup`, and then once you have keys and such setup, you can ssh clone to the workspace
3. [Generate an SSH key for the computer and load to ssh agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
4. Add the SSH key to github
5. Reclone mac-setup to `workspace/` with ssh
3. Run `manual_scripts/publish_gitconfig`. This will set the git config, so that we can check in any changes we make.
3. Run `./install.sh`
3. Fix any issues (check fixes in)
4. Set iterm preferences from file: iTerm2 > Settings > General > Settings > Load settings from a custom folder or URL and select the manual_scripts dir.

Download and install the following manually
