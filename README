Scripts to setup a mac workstation how I like it.


## TO FIX:
### 8/6/24
[ ] shell load error: `mac/Users/ctaymor/.zshrc:.:14: no such file or directory: /opt/homebrew/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme`

## Improvements TODO:
[ ] Run shellcheck on vim save (or on commit?)
[ ] Add Notion?
[ ] Add Intellij
[ ] iterm preferences like Dark mode?
[ ] why is command prompt not getting set properly by powerlevel10k

# Usage
## pre-setup on brand new mac
1. Download xtools from the app store (theoretcially `xcode-select --install` will work, but it doesn't always). This will install git
2. Get ssh keys set up
3. Clone this repo, and run `./install.sh`
3. Fix any issues (check fixes in)
3. Run `manual_scripts/publish_gitconfig`
4. Set iterm preferences from file: iTerm2 > Settings > General > Settings > Load settings from a custom folder or URL and select the manual_scripts dir.

Download and install the following manually
