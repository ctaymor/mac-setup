Scripts to setup a mac workstation how I like it.

## TO FIX:
### 8/6/24
[ ] shell load error: `mac/Users/ctaymor/.zshrc:.:14: no such file or directory: /opt/homebrew/opt/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k.zsh-theme`
[ ] Telescope isn't working right - the fzf extension isn't loading correctly.

## Improvements TODO:
[ ] Run shellcheck on vim save (or on commit?)

Download and install the following manually:
