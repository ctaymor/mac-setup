# Making Heuristics Explicit

It can be very helpful to name the mental heuristics we're using. It allows us to do better metacognition.
## Some examples of helpful heuristics:

### Am I frustrated, or overwhelmed?
#### If I'm frustrated
I probably need MORE data. I need to use broadening techniques to either expand what I know about the problem, or just expand my awareness of what I already know.
Sample Techniques:
- brainstorm
- exploring
- open ended experimentation
- taking detailed notes
- talking to an expert
- reading docs
#### If I'm overwhelmed:
I probably need LESS data, so I need to narrow down what's relevant and rule some things out.
Sample Techniques:
- pick one hypothesis, and design an experiement to disprove it.
- question shrinking
- pick one question to explore, make the others out of scope for now
- Make an assumption. Explore what would be true if it were true.
